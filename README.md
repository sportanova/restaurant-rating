Restaurant rating with couchbd. Indexing restauraunts 120 different ways, so you can search for restaurants along 5 different categories, from 1-5. Requires remapping the original map-reduce and emitting new results, which requires 5! indexes with couchdb. Not efficient in terms of space, but couchdb is pretty cool.
